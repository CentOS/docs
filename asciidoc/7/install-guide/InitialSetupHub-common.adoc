* Using the `Server with GUI` base environment in the {PRODUCT} setup.

* Using a Kickstart file that contains one of the following entries in the `%packages` section:
+
** the [package]*initial-setup-gui* package for graphical mode
+
** the [package]*initial-setup* package for text mode
+
** the [package]*x11* group
+
** the [package]*gnome-desktop* group

....
firstboot --enable --reconfig

In order to continue with the configuration process, the license agreement must be accepted. Exiting [application]*Initial Setup* without completing this step will cause the system to restart, and once the system finishes rebooting, you will be prompted to accept the agreement again.

Review the license agreement. Then, select `I accept the license agreement.` and click btn:[Done] to continue.

The `User Creation` screen is the same as the one used when creating an account during the installation. See <<sect-account-configuration-user-x86>> for detailed information.

Similarly, the `Network & Host Name` screen is the same as the one used when setting up network. See <<sect-network-hostname-configuration-x86>> for information.

The `Subscription Manager` screen allows you to register your system with Red{nbsp}Hat to receive updates and install additional packages from repositories provided by Red{nbsp}Hat. For information about how to register your system, see <<sect-initial-setup-subsciption-manager>>.

Once ready, click the btn:[FINISH CONFIGURATION] button to register your system, before completing the [application]*Initial Setup* configuration process.

To start the [application]*Initial Setup* again, see <<starting_initial_setup_manually>>.
