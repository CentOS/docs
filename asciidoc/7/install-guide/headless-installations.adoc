== Headless Systems

When installing headless systems, you can only choose between an automated Kickstart installation and an interactive VNC installation using Connect Mode. For more information about automated Kickstart installation, see <<sect-kickstart-commands>>. The general process for interactive VNC installation is described below.

. Set up a network boot server to start the installation. Information about installing and performing basic configurating of a network boot server can be found in <<chap-installation-server-setup>>.

. Configure the server to use the boot options for a Connect Mode VNC installation. For information on these boot options, see <<sect-vnc-installations-connect-mode>>.

. Follow the procedure for VNC Installation using Connect Mode as described in the procedure <<proc-vnc-installations-connect-mode>>. However, when directed to boot the system, boot it from the network server instead of local media.
