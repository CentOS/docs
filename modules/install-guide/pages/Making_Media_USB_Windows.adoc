=== Making Installation USB Media on Windows

The procedure of creating bootable USB media on Windows depends on which tool you use. There are many different utilities which allow you to write an ISO image to a USB drive. {PRODUCT} recommends using the [application]*Fedora Media Writer*, available for download at link:++https://github.com/MartinBriza/MediaWriter/releases++[].

[IMPORTANT]
====

Transferring the ISO image file to the USB drive using Windows Explorer or a similar file manager will not work - you will not be able to boot from the device.
