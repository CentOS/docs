After you started a new {PRODUCT} system the first time, the [application]*Initial Setup* application launches, if you installed the server:

* Using the `Server with GUI` base environment in the {PRODUCT} setup.

* Using a Kickstart file that contains one of the following entries in the `%packages` section:
+
** the [package]*initial-setup-gui* package for graphical mode
+
** the [package]*initial-setup* package for text mode
+
** the [package]*x11* group
+
** the [package]*gnome-desktop* group
+
** the [package]*kde-desktop* group

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Graphical User Interface|Text User Interface

						footnote:[This option is only displayed if you did not previously agreed to the license.]|Yes|Yes

[IMPORTANT]
====

Options set during the setup are not displayed in the [application]*Initial Setup*. To display all options in [application]*Initial Setup*, you must install {PRODUCT} using a Kickstart file that contains the following command:

[literal,subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
....
firstboot --enable --reconfig
....

The [option]`--reconfig` option specifies that all options should be displayed. For further details about Kickstart installations, see xref:Kickstart2.adoc#chap-kickstart-installations[Kickstart Installations].

[[initial-setup_GUI]]
== Graphical Mode

In graphical mode, the [application]*Initial Setup* displays the following screen:

.Main Initial Setup Screen

image::{imagesdir}/initial-setup/is-firstscreen.png[Initial Setup Screen]

The `License Agreement` screen displays the overall licensing terms for {PRODUCT}.

.License Information Screen

image::{imagesdir}/initial-setup/is-license.png[License Information Screen in Initial Setup]

In order to continue with the configuration process, the license agreement must be accepted. Exiting [application]*Initial Setup* without completing this step will cause the system to restart, and once the system finishes rebooting, you will be prompted to accept the agreement again.

Review the license agreement. Then, select `I accept the license agreement.` and click btn:[Done] to continue.

The `User Creation` screen is the same as the one used when creating an account during the installation. See xref:UserSpoke-x86.adoc#sect-account-configuration-user-x86[Create a User Account (x86)] for detailed information.

Similarly, the `Network & Host Name` screen is the same as the one used when setting up network. See xref:NetworkSpoke-x86.adoc#sect-network-hostname-configuration-x86[Network & Hostname (x86)] for information.

Once ready, click the btn:[FINISH CONFIGURATION] button to exit [application]*Initial Setup*.

To start the [application]*Initial Setup* again, see xref:InitialSetupHub-common.adoc#starting_initial_setup_manually[Starting Initial Setup Manually.

[[sect-initial-setup-text]]
== Text Mode

If you installed {PRODUCT} without the [application]*X Window System*, the [application]*Initial Setup* starts in text mode:

.[application]*Initial Setup* in text mode

To configure an entry, enter the menu number and press kbd:[Enter]. Additionally, you can press the following keys:

* kbd:[q] to close the application. Until you accepted the license agreement, closing the application causes the system to reboot.

* kbd:[c] to continue. Pressing this key in a submenu returns you to the main menu. In the main menu, pressing the kbd:[c] key stores the settings and closes the application. Note that you cannot continue without accepting the license agreement.

* kbd:[r] to refresh the menu.

Menu entries can have different statuses:

* [option]`[x]`: This setting is already configured. However, you can change the setting.

* [option]`[!]`: This setting is mandatory but not yet set.

* [option]`[{nbsp}]`: This setting is optional and not yet set.

To start the [application]*Initial Setup* again, see xref:InitialSetupHub-common.adoc#starting_initial_setup_manually[Starting Initial Setup Manually.

[[starting_initial_setup_manually]]
== Starting Initial Setup Manually

Once you once finished the [application]*Initial Setup*, the application does not start again when you boot the system. To manually start the [application]*Initial Setup* on system boot:

. Enable the service:
+
[literal,subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
....
# systemctl enable initial-setup.service
....

. Optionally, to display all menu options, including the ones previously set, create an empty `/.unconfigured` file to start [application]*Initial Setup* in reconfiguration mode:
+
[literal,subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
....
# touch /.unconfigured
....
+
Note that, regardless of this setting, the license agreement entry is not displayed again if you previously accepted it.

. Reboot the system.
