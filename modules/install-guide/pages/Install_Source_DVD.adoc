== Installation Source on a DVD

You can burn the binary DVD ISO image onto a DVD and configure the installation program to install packages from this disk while booting the installation from another drive (for example, a minimal boot ISO on a USB flash drive). This procedure is the same as creating bootable optical media - see xref:Making_Media_Optical.adoc#sect-making-cd-dvd-media[Making an Installation CD or DVD] for more information.

When using a DVD as an installation source, make sure the DVD is in the drive when the installation begins. The [application]*Anaconda* installation program is not able to detect media inserted after the installation begins.
