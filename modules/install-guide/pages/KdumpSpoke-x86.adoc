Use this screen to select whether or not to use [application]*Kdump* on this system. [application]*Kdump* is a kernel crash dumping mechanism which, in the event of a system crash, captures information that can be invaluable in determining the cause of the crash.

Note that if you enable [application]*Kdump*, you must reserve a certain amount of system memory for it. As a result, less memory is available for your processes.

If you do not want to use [application]*Kdump* on this system, uncheck btn:[Enable kdump]. Otherwise, set the amount of memory to reserve for [application]*Kdump*. You can let the installer reserve a reasonable amount automatically, or you can set any amount manually. When your are satisfied with the settings, click btn:[Done] to save the configuration and return to the previous screen.
